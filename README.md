# cluster_unlabelled_dataset
Using Gaussian Mixture Models Clustering and k-Means clustering on the
seeds dataset.

How to run the code:

Both the files can be run independently. Run "gaussian_mixture_models" or "plot_kmeans_seeds". This will
result in the plotted clusters. 
Or you can run the main method which should run both the methods for you and result
in two plotted clusters.
