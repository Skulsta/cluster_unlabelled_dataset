How to run the code:
THe file path of the data set needs to be set in the row where data is defined(data =). Replace the name of your dataset 
in the field where "seeds_dataset.txt" is currently. This will assure that the the main method will run smoothly.
If you use the default name and it is placed in the folder of the main method, it should work automatically.

Run the main.py file, and the two visualizations of K-means and GMM will occur in the Sci-View frame. Doing this,
the specific labelling will be presented in the terminal.
 
If you want to run each algorithms alone, comment out the method you don't want to 
run. The gaussian_kmeans_models.py and plot_kmeans_seeds.py needs to be run through the main method to show
plot and print to terminal.

To see how we used Silhouette score analysis and elbow analysis, run silhouette_score_analysis.py
and elbow_analysis.py and their results will occur in the terminal and in the Sci-View frame. This is done
independently of the main method.
